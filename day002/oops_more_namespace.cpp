/*

The line using namespace std; is a common directive in C++ programming. 
It's used to simplify the code by bringing all the names (symbols) from 
the std namespace into the current scope.



In C++, the Standard Library (often referred to as the Standard Template Library or STL) 
provides a vast collection of classes, functions, and objects that help programmers 
accomplish various tasks without having to reinvent the wheel. 
These components are organized within the std namespace to avoid 
naming conflicts between different libraries or user-defined symbols.



When you include the line using namespace std; at the beginning of your C++ program,
 you're essentially telling the compiler that you want to use all the names from
  the std namespace directly, without needing to explicitly specify the namespace
   each time you use a component from the Standard Library.



For example, without using namespace std;, 
you might need to write code like this to use cout (the standard output stream):

cpp
Copy code


#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, world!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}



However, by using using namespace std;, you can simplify the code:



cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, world!" << endl;
    return 0;
}



While this can make your code shorter and more readable, 
there are potential downsides to using using namespace std; excessively.
 One main concern is that it might lead to naming conflicts if multiple 
 libraries are used or if you define your own symbols with the same name
  as those in the std namespace. In larger projects, it's often recommended
   to avoid the global using namespace std; and 
   instead use the std:: prefix to indicate explicitly that you're using 
   a component from the Standard Library.



In summary, using namespace std; is a directive 
in C++ that makes the symbols from the std namespace available 
in the current scope, making it easier to use components from the C++ Standard Library.
