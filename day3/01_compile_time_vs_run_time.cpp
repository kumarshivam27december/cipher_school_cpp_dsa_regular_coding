/*

"Compile time" and "run time" are two distinct phases in the lifecycle of a computer program. 
These terms refer to different stages of program execution:




Compile Time:
Compile time, also known as "build time," is the phase when the source code of a program 
is translated into machine code (or intermediate code) by a compiler. 
During this phase, syntax errors and certain types of logical errors are detected. 
The compiler checks the code for correctness, generates object files, 
and resolves references to functions and variables. 
If the code successfully compiles, it produces an executable file that can be run later.



Key tasks during compile time:  

Syntax checking

Type checking

Generating object code

Linking (in some cases)




Compile-time errors prevent the program from being successfully compiled 
and won't produce an executable file.



Run Time:

Run time is the phase when the compiled program is executed on a computer's hardware. 
The executable code runs, and the program's functionality is realized. 
During this phase, the program interacts with users, processes data, 
and performs various operations as specified by the source code. 
During run time, the program may encounter additional errors 
that were not caught during compile time, such as input validation errors 
or unexpected runtime conditions.






Key activities during run time:

Data processing

User interaction

Memory allocation and deallocation

Error handling (including exceptions)


Run-time errors occur while the program is running and can lead to unexpected behavior, 
crashes, or incorrect results.

In summary, compile time refers to the phase when the source code is 
compiled into machine code, and errors are detected prior to execution. 
Run time refers to the actual execution of the compiled program on the computer's hardware, 
during which the program's intended functionality is executed, 
and additional errors may be encountered.
