In C++, both literals and constants are fundamental concepts related to values used in your programs, but they have slightly different meanings and purposes.

Literals:

Literals in C++ are values that are directly used in your code to represent themselves. They are constants by nature but are not necessarily named. Literals can be of various types, including integers, floating-point numbers, characters, strings, and more.

Here are a few examples of literals:

cpp
Copy code
int num = 42;       // Integer literal
double pi = 3.1415; // Floating-point literal
char letter = 'A';  // Character literal
std::string name = "Alice"; // String literal
Constants:

Constants in C++ are named values that are given a symbolic name and are not allowed to change their value during the program's execution. They are typically used to improve code readability, maintainability, and to avoid magic numbers (unexplained numerical values).

C++ provides a few ways to declare constants:

Using const: The const keyword is used to declare a named constant. This constant is evaluated at runtime.
cpp
Copy code
const int myConstant = 10;
Using constexpr: The constexpr keyword indicates that the value of the constant must be evaluated at compile-time, whenever possible.
cpp
Copy code
constexpr double pi = 3.14159;
Using enum: An enumeration can be used to define named integral constants.
cpp
Copy code
enum Color {
    Red = 0xFF0000,
    Green = 0x00FF00,
    Blue = 0x0000FF
};
Constants are useful for defining values that should not change and for providing meaningful names to those values. 
They can help make your code more self-explanatory and easier to maintain.

In summary, literals are direct values used in your code, while constants are named values that are declared using the const or constexpr keyword and have a specific scope within your program. Both literals and constants contribute to the overall readability and maintainability of your code.
