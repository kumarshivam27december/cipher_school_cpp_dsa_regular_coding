/*

A "Segmentation Fault" (often abbreviated as "segfault") is a runtime error that occurs in a program when it tries to access a memory location that it does not have permission to access. This typically happens due to programming errors like accessing an invalid memory address, dereferencing a null pointer, or overrunning the bounds of an array.

In C++, segmentation faults are commonly caused by the following situations:

Dereferencing Null Pointers: Trying to access the value pointed to by a pointer that has not been initialized (i.e., it points to memory address 0 or nullptr).
cpp
Copy code
int* ptr = nullptr;
int value = *ptr; // This will result in a segmentation fault
Array Index Out of Bounds: Accessing an element of an array using an index that is outside the valid range.
cpp
Copy code
int arr[5];
int value = arr[10]; // This may lead to a segmentation fault if arr has fewer than 11 elements
Buffer Overflow: Writing data beyond the allocated memory bounds of an array or buffer.
cpp
Copy code
char buffer[10];
strcpy(buffer, "This is a very long string that exceeds the buffer size"); // Potential segmentation fault
Accessing Freed Memory: Trying to access memory that has been deallocated using delete or free.
cpp
Copy code
int* ptr = new int;
delete ptr;
int value = *ptr; // Segmentation fault because ptr points to freed memory
Stack Overflow: Exceeding the available stack space due to excessive recursion or large local variable allocations.
cpp
Copy code
void recursiveFunction(int n) {
    recursiveFunction(n + 1); // May lead to a stack overflow
}
Executing Data as Code: Attempting to execute memory that is marked as data rather than code.
These are just a few examples of scenarios that can lead to segmentation faults. To diagnose and fix segmentation faults, you can use tools like debuggers, memory profilers, and careful code inspection. It's important to follow best practices for memory management and pointer handling to avoid such runtime errors in your C++ programs.
