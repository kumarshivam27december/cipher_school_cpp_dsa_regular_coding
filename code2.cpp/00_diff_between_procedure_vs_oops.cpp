// procedural approach

/*
struct users{
    int age;
    string name;
    bool adult;
    float bankbalance;
    int last_ten_transaction[10] ;
}

//
now if we wanted to make data of 100 user we will make array of type struct

if i wanted to add 100 rupees in the bank balances 


it is difficult to add another account of a person in this way we can say this that procedural approach
is very different from real life problems

so the concept of oops come here
