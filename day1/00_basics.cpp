/*

C++ is a powerful and versatile programming language widely used for system development, 
game development, application software, and more. Here are some fundamental concepts and 
syntax you might find useful:



Basic Structure:



C++ programs have a main() function which is the entry point.
Statements are terminated with a semicolon ;.


Data Types:

C++ has built-in data types like int, double, char, bool, etc.
You can use the sizeof() operator to determine the size of a data type in bytes.



Variables and Constants:

Variables are declared with a data type and an optional initial value.
Constants are declared with the const keyword.
Use cin for input and cout for output.



Operators:

Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, %.
Relational operators: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=.
Logical operators: &&, ||, !.




Control Structures:

if, else if, else for conditional branching.
switch for multi-way branching.
for, while, do-while for loops.
 



Functions:

Functions are defined with a return type, name, parameters, and a body.
You can pass arguments by value or reference.
Recursive functions call themselves.




Arrays and Pointers:

Arrays hold a fixed-size collection of elements of the same data type.
Pointers store memory addresses.
Arrays and pointers are closely related.



Classes and Objects:

C++ supports object-oriented programming.
Classes define the blueprint for objects.
Objects are instances of classes.




Inheritance and Polymorphism:

Inheritance allows creating a new class based on an existing class.
Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class.



Dynamic Memory Allocation:

new allocates memory on the heap.
delete deallocates memory.




Exception Handling:

try, catch, and throw are used for exception handling.



Standard Template Library (STL):

Provides useful classes and functions for common tasks.
Includes containers like vector, list, map, etc.
Includes algorithms like sorting and searching.
Remember, these are just some key concepts. 




C++ is a vast language with many advanced features and libraries. 
As you progress, you'll delve into more complex topics like templates, operator overloading,
 memory management, and more. Always refer to up-to-date resources and 
 documentation as you continue your C++ journey.
